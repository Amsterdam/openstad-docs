For a blank page choose the "default" template. For a dynamic idea page choose idea type, this page will expect an idea ID in the url. For example /idea/102 will automatically load in the data voor the idea with ID 102. Read more on: [Submitting & editing ideas](manual/submitting-editing-ideas.md).
